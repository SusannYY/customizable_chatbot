# Customized chatbot

This repo contains the instructions and code for the creation of a customized chatbot that can be embedded into a qualtrics survey.
It is customized because you can change for the model that you want (gpt3.5, gpt4, etc.) and because you can customize system instructions.
The goal is that you can easily customize OpenAI chatbots to behave however you want and embed them into qualtrics for running experiments.

## You'll need
There is a lot you'll need before you begin building your chatbot app.
- An account with the OpenAI API. 
You'll need to set up a payment method and get an API key (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).
- A mySQL database hosted online.
In this tutorial, I'll be using google clod for hosting. It's one of the easiest ways to do it. If you want to do it the same way, you'll have to create an account and set up payment method.(https://console.cloud.google.com).
You will also need to create a database and get all its credentials (user, passoword, IP, port)
